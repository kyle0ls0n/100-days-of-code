<h1> Kyle's 100 Days of Code Log </h1>
<p><em>Day 1</em>: January 1, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: worked on Weather App, learning about API calls and keys. Still a lot to learn, but feel like I took a step forward!<p>
<div></div>
<p><em>Day 2</em>: January 2, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: did some more work on the weather app, with the help of a Coding Tutorials 360 video. I'm ALMOST there, just trying to figure out how to use the Weather ID #'s from the OpenWeatherMap API to dictate which weather icon is displayed on my page (ie: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy, etc).</br>
<em>UPDATE</em>: figured out the Weather ID bug, and now just waiting to put some finishing touches on the layout and design of the app! Woohoo!</p>
<p><em>Day 3</em>: January 3, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: finished up the weather app. First, I added a changing border to the weather icon, depending on the conditions. <em>(ie: if it was rainy, the icon is raindrops with a blue-ish, grey border. If it's sunny, the icon is a sun with a pink border).</em> Then I added a background image that changes depending on if it is daytime or nighttime. It's all submitted to Free Code Camp, and I am moving onto the Wikipedia Viewer!</br>

<p><em>Day 4</em>: January 4, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: I started on the Wikipedia Viewer page! I'm getting a little more creative with CSS and layout, which is fun! I started on a skeleton of the JavaScript. Basically, from here I need to learn how the Wikipedia API works, and implement it on my app. Then I'll figure out the layout and look of the search results, and what happens if they search twice, or if there is a "clear search" option.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong>: January 5, 2017 </br>
<strong>Description</strong>: I made huge headway with my Wikipedia Viewer today. I learned about how the Wikipedia API works, what parameters should be called and how. I ran into lots of bugs along the way, including a problem where my search results were being displayed in reverse order. I altered the For loop to count backwards, and the issue was solved! I'm currently having a difficult time getting the 'keypress' method to work. My intention is for the search engine to work when you press "Enter." But Ajax is sending me a fail message. So I'll work some more on that, and also style the CSS of the result table to look as rad as the rest of the app!</p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong>: January 6, 2017 </br>
<strong>Description</strong>: Excited to say I have finished the Wikipedia viewer. I was mainly working with CSS and a little HTML today. I wanted a specific look for the search results (curved corners on the table format, a little padding between borders and content). I also added a placeholder to the text input field. I think the design is kind of cool! Looking forward to the next challenge!</br>

<p><em>Day 7</em>: January 8, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: I missed yesterday because of a ski trip! But today I was back, getting the basics together for the TwitchTV app. I'm not familiar with the service, so I'm not exactly sure of the purpose for this app. What I do know is that it uses a API call to retrieve info from a Streaming Channel. My app should indicate if a certain channel is online or offline, and, if it is online, what program it is showing. I should also be able to display which users are online and what they are watching. This is going to take getting familiar with TwitchTV's API and the different elements involved with the URL. I really want to know this thing inside and out, because I believe JSON is really important part of jQuery. It seems to be involved with most projects Free Code Camp is throwing my way!</p>
<p><em>Day 8</em>: January 9, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: Today I did a lot of work on the TwitchTV app. I have stuck to my plan to stay away from YouTube and other help/tutorials. I have completed a few of the User Story requirements, and I'm getting much better at navigating API calls. I can tell you if a certain channel is currently streaming or not. I still have to solve how to display if and what certain Users are streaming. I think I'm getting closer though!</p>
<p><em>Day 9</em>: January 10, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: I hit a wall with the TwitchTV app, and had to seek out help with the API addresses for the User portion of the challenge. The YouTube channel, 360 Tutorial, has been so helpful with these projects. I finished the app -- it's not perfect, but I think I should keep moving forward. I have definitely learned a ton about API's and continue to keep learning more as I go. I did an Algorithm back on FCC, and remembered how difficult these things are. Wish me luck!</br>

<p><em>Day 10</em>: January 11, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: I was feeling under the weather today, so I only did a couple Algorithms. I'm really struggling with callback functions and how to use them. It seems like this magical element that you just drop into code, and it does the job of 5 For Loops.</p>
<p><strong>Day 11</strong>: January 12, 2017 </br>
<strong>Description</strong>: Today was very productive! I worked on about 5 algorithms, and solved a few of them without any help! I still struggled with callback functions, so I spent some time watching tutorial videos on Callback Functions themselves. I did not make it to Coffee & Code tonight. I really need to make an effort next time! </p>
<p><strong>Day 12</strong>: January 13, 2017 </br>
<strong>Description</strong>: Worked for a while on the "Convert HTML Entities" alogrithm. Needed help, so found the solution, and then learned backwards. Definitely know a lot more about Regular Expressions and the .replace() method now!</p>
<p><strong>Day 13</strong>: Jamuary 14, 2017</br>
<strong>Description</strong>: Feel good about the work I did today! Worked through a couple algorithms: "Spinal Tap Case" and "Sum of All Fibonacci Numbers." I got part of the Spinal Case problem right away, but had to learn a little more about the .replace() method, and how to add space in the middle of alphanumeric characters with the "$1 $2" argument. Then I totally nailed the Fibonacci Number problem! All right! </p>
