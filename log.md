<h1> Kyle's 100 Days of Code Log </h1>
<p><em>Day 1</em>: January 1, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: worked on Weather App, learning about API calls and keys. Still a lot to learn, but feel like I took a step forward!<p>
<div></div>
<p><em>Day 2</em>: January 2, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: did some more work on the weather app, with the help of a Coding Tutorials 360 video. I'm ALMOST there, just trying to figure out how to use the Weather ID #'s from the OpenWeatherMap API to dictate which weather icon is displayed on my page (ie: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy, etc).</br>
<em>UPDATE</em>: figured out the Weather ID bug, and now just waiting to put some finishing touches on the layout and design of the app! Woohoo!</p>
<p><em>Day 3</em>: January 3, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: finished up the weather app. First, I added a changing border to the weather icon, depending on the conditions. <em>(ie: if it was rainy, the icon is raindrops with a blue-ish, grey border. If it's sunny, the icon is a sun with a pink border).</em> Then I added a background image that changes depending on if it is daytime or nighttime. It's all submitted to Free Code Camp, and I am moving onto the Wikipedia Viewer!</br>

<p><em>Day 4</em>: January 4, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: I started on the Wikipedia Viewer page! I'm getting a little more creative with CSS and layout, which is fun! I started on a skeleton of the JavaScript. Basically, from here I need to learn how the Wikipedia API works, and implement it on my app. Then I'll figure out the layout and look of the search results, and what happens if they search twice, or if there is a "clear search" option.</p>
