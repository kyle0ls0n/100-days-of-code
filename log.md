<h1> Kyle's 100 Days of Code Log </h1>
<p><em>Day 1</em>: January 1, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: worked on Weather App, learning about API calls and keys. Still a lot to learn, but feel like I took a step forward!<p>

<p><em>Day 2</em>: January 2, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: did some more work on the weather app, with the help of a Coding Tutorials 360 video. I'm ALMOST there, just trying to figure out how to use the Weather ID #'s from the OpenWeatherMap API to dictate which weather icon is displayed on my page (ie: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy, etc).</br>
<em>UPDATE</em>: figured out the Weather ID bug, and now just waiting to put some finishing touches on the layout and design of the app! Woohoo!</p>
<p><em>Day 3</em>: January 3, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: finished up the weather app, by stylizing a changing border around the weather icons, depending on the conditions. <em>(ie: if it was rainy, the icon is raindrops with a blue-ish, grey border. If it's sunny, the icon is a sun with a pink border).</em> I also added a background image that changes depending on if it is daytime or nighttime. Then I submitted the page to Free Code Camp, and I am moving onto the Wikipedia Viewer.</br>
