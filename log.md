<h1> Kyle's 100 Days of Code Log </h1>

<em>Description</em>: worked on Weather App, learning about API calls and keys. Still a lot to learn, but feel like I took a step forward!<p>

<p><em>Day 2</em>: January 2, 2017 </br>
<em>Description</em>: did some more work on the weather app, with the help of a Coding Tutorials 360 video. I'm ALMOST there, just trying to figure out how to use the Weather ID #'s from the OpenWeatherMap API to dictate which weather icon is displayed on my page (ie: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy, etc). </p>
<p><em>update</em>: figured out the Weather ID bug, and now just waiting to put some finishing touches on the layout and design of the app! Woohoo!</p>
